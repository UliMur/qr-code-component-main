## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

I learned how to create a QR code component and how to use CSS to style its layout and content.

This project taught me the importance of using semantic HTML elements to structure web pages and improve accessibility.

Through this project, I gained experience with responsive design techniques and how to make a website look great on different screen sizes.

I learned how to organize my CSS code and use best practices to make it more readable and maintainable.

### Continued development

I want to continue refining my skills in responsive design and exploring more advanced techniques such as flexbox and CSS grid.

In future projects, I want to focus on improving website performance by optimizing images and code, and implementing best practices for loading speed.

I want to further develop my skills in JavaScript and learn more about front-end frameworks and libraries, such as React and Vue.js, to build more complex and dynamic web applications.
